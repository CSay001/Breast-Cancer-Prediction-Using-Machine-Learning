# Breast-Cancer-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
In this lesson, I built and deployed a Logistic Regression classifier for classifying cancerous tumors as malignant or benign.
#
The project includes:

*Logistic Regression Classifier:* Learn how to develop a logistic regression model to classify cancer data. Detailed instructions are provided to help you understand the algorithm, implement the classifier, and evaluate its performance.

*Dataset Management:* Learn to download datasets directly from Kaggle using the Kaggle API. The repository includes scripts and instructions for setting up the Kaggle API and fetching datasets efficiently.

*Google Colab Integration:* Work with Google Colab in the cloud to run your analysis and model training. This setup allows you to leverage powerful cloud resources for executing your code and managing experiments.
